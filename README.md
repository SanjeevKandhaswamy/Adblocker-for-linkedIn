This code is published here to give an Adblocker for LinkedIn. 
You may ask why LinkedIn specifically, that is because whenever LinkedIn pushes an advertisement to us, it tags the advertisement as 'promoted' unlike many other social media.
We use this knowledge to block the ads that come on our LinkedIn feed.
If you guys want to use it as a browser extension, then here are the steps:-
1) Go to settings.
2) Go to extensions.
3) Toggle on 'Developer Mode'.
4) Some buttons appear on top of your page.
5) Click 'Load Unpacked' and select your file directory from the file browser.

And, that's it. You can now use this code to block the ads in your LinkedIn feed.
